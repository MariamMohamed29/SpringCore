## Introduction to Spring Framework

### What is Spring?

Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.
Spring enables you to build applications from “plain old Java objects” (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs. This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE.

#### Examples of how you, as an application developer, can use the Spring platform advantage:

-Make a Java method execute in a database transaction without having to deal with transaction APIs.

-Make a local Java method a remote procedure without having to deal with remote APIs.

-Make a local Java method a management operation without having to deal with JMX APIs.

-Make a local Java method a message handler without having to deal with JMS APIs.
### Reasons to Use Spring Framework in Projects
There are many reasons for which Spring is one of the best choices for developing our project as it is open-source, stable, and many more. It is one of the most trusted frameworks for building projects or developing enterprise applications when working with the Java tech stack and projects written in Java are more secure and robust.
We’ll discuss reasons to use the Spring Framework in the projects in this repository:
1. **Easy, Simple, and Lightweight**
   Let’s admit that we look for easier things first! Spring is easy to learn and implement which is composed of modules where we can write spring applications normally with interfaces 
    and abstract classes just like java applications.
   Spring helps in coupling and wiring the components which make working with Spring easier and simpler as we can focus more on our application rather than its implementation.
   It is lightweight as we can inject dependencies as per our need without having to include each of them thus saving the project from unnecessary memory utilization.
